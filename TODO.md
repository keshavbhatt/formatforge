### Format support and loading for media files
```
[] figure out supported formats based on ffmpeg build 	
	[] get supported formats and codecs to generate list of extensions supported in open file dialog
```

### Create generic command editors for each supported media type (Audio, video... etc)

```
[] the goal is to load from existing preset or create custom commands for conversion by manually changing each supported operation
```
